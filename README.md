# COCO-PUF Analysis with Linear Regression

## Overview

In this project, we focused on analyzing and cracking the **COCO-PUF** (Cross-Connection Physically Unclonable Function) using **linear regression**. The COCO-PUF is an advanced cryptographic primitive that introduces complexity to the traditional Arbiter PUF by incorporating additional cross-connections. This makes it difficult to predict responses using traditional methods. 

Our approach leveraged the observation that by gathering enough **challenge-response pairs (CRPs)**, the behavior of a COCO-PUF can be approximated using linear models. The primary objective was to break down the COCO-PUF into simpler models and predict the response to different challenges using **linear regression**.

### Key Concepts

- **COCO-PUF**: A physically unclonable function based on interconnected switches, where each switch introduces unique time delays. The challenge bits determine the path of the signal, and the resulting output is a response unique to each challenge.
  
- **Linear Regression**: A method used to model the relationship between the challenge-response pairs (CRPs) and predict the response of the COCO-PUF based on historical data.

- **Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs)**: Pairs consisting of a challenge input (bit) and its corresponding output (response) from the COCO-PUF, which are used to train the regression model.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: We generated a large dataset of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) by simulating the behavior of the COCO-PUF. This dataset consists of a series of challenges (binary values) and their corresponding responses (binary outcomes).

2. **Linear Regression Model**: 
   - The core idea was to use linear regression to predict the output response based on the challenge input.
   - We trained the model using the CRPs to estimate the parameters of the linear model.
   - The model learned the relationship between the challenge and the response.

3. **Model Training**: We trained a linear regression model using the CRPs and evaluated the modelâ€™s ability to predict responses for unseen challenges.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was assessed using metrics like **accuracy** and **mean squared error** (MSE), by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure reliable evaluation.

## Results

The linear regression model was able to predict the response of the COCO-PUF based on the challenge bits. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy and mean squared error (MSE), and the results demonstrated that linear regression could approximate the behavior of the COCO-PUF reasonably well, although the accuracy may vary depending on the complexity of the PUF and the size of the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that **linear regression** can be an effective tool for approximating the behavior of the COCO-PUF by leveraging challenge-response pairs. Although this method provides a simple approach to predicting responses, it also highlights the possibility of using more advanced models in the future to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Future Work

Future improvements may involve using more advanced models such as **neural networks** or **ensemble methods** to enhance the prediction accuracy. Additionally, employing more sophisticated data generation techniques can further improve the model's performance by simulating a broader range of challenge-response scenarios.
